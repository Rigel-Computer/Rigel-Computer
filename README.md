## About

This GitHub profile focuses on topics related to the local deployment of large language models (LLMs), container-based development environments, and practical applications of generative AI. Core interests include optimizing AI on CPU-based systems, multilingual prompt pipelines, and building maintainable open-source tools.

## 🔍 Areas of Interest

- Local LLMs with multi-container deployment using [`llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) and GGUF weights
- Docker & DDEV for reproducible dev environments
- Prompt translation for multilingual GenAI workflows  
- Lightweight API development for local inference  
- Structured data extraction from PDFs on local LLMs
- ⚡ All about TYPO3 and -extension development (filters, categories, frontend logic)
- Classical Machine Learning (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy)  
- Git & GitHub workflows

## 🚧 Currently Exploring

- Lightweight deployment and fine-tuning of LLMs in an local Docker enviroment on CPU-only systems 
- Translator-enhanced prompt pipelines with small weights to avoid translation-problems to German 
- Persistent container setups for AI tooling and ML issues

## 🤝 Collaboration

Open to collaborating on:
- Private & local AI infrastructure  
- Practical GenAI workflows with translation layers  
- Developer-focused documentation & tooling  
- Resource-efficient setups for real-world use
- TYPO3
